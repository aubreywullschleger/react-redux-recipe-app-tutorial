# [Recipe App with React and Redux tutorial]()
---
This project is a re-build of my vanilla JS [Recipe App](https://aubsrey-recipe-app.netlify.com/index.html) as a way to practice and understand React, Redux, and the entire workflow for bulding a React app from scratch without boilerplate code or `create-react-app`.
